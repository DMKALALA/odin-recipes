    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>The ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (85% lean) </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sriracha hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 slider-size burger buns</li>
        <li>4 leaves lettuce</li>
        <li>4 slices tomato</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Here is How you make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Break up ground beef with the tip of a fork in a bowl. Drizzle in the soy sauce, sake, mirin, Worcestershire sauce, and sriracha sauce; crumble in brown sugar. Use tines of a fork to evenly distribute ingredients. Finish mixing with your hands (ideally your hands should be very cold for this). Shape into 4 equal-sized patties.</li>
        <li>Grill until browned and cooked through turning once, 3 or 4 minutes per side. When burgers develop a slight dome shape and juices begin to come through the top surface, they are done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve burgers on slider buns with lettuce and tomato slices.</li>
        
    </ol>

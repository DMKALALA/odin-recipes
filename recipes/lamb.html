    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>The ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bread crumbs:</b> Use store-bought or make your own bread crumbs. </li>
        <li><b>Seasonings:</b> This rack of lamb is seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper.  </li>
        <li><b>Olive oil:</b> Olive oil locks in moisture, preventing the meat from drying out.  </li>
        <li><b>Lamb:</b> If you can, have your butcher trim and french (remove excess meat, fat and cartilage) the rack of lamb so you donâ€™t have to do it at home.  </li>
        <li><b>Mustard:</b> Dijon mustard gives the seasoned bread crumbs something to stick to. Plus, it adds irresistible flavor.  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Here is How you make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center position.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.</li>
        
    </ol>
